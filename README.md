Awe is a **small and customizable** game engine made as **a passion project** to learn more about game and web development.

This project tries to make things its own way by proposing a **graph based structure** instead of a traditional ECS.

I prefer to warn you that this project was **made for personal use** but nothing is stopping you from using it or contributing.

## CI/CD Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD jobs.

We have workflows to:
- Build and test the project on each pull request.
- Build, test and release the project.
- Generate a documentation and deploy it.

Learn more about the CI/CD workflows [here](./.github/WORKFLOWS.md).

## Contributing
Any help and contribution is welcome, feel free to submit issues and/or contribute to the project.

**Please read through the [contributing guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.**
