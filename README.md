Ineka is a **small and customizable** game engine made as **a passion project** to learn more about game and web development.

This project tries to make things its own way by proposing a **graph based structure** instead of a traditional ECS.

I prefer to warn you that this project was **made for personal use** but nothing is stopping you from using it or contributing.

## Installation

The installation is pretty simple, just install the package using a package manager:
```bash
npm install @ineka/engine
```

Then use a bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle your game.

A template repository will be available in the future to quickly bootstrap games made with Ineka.

## CI/CD Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD jobs.

We have workflows to:
- Build and test the project on each pull request.
- Build, test and release the project.
- Generate a documentation and deploy it.

## Contributing
Any help and contribution is welcome, feel free to submit issues and/or contribute to the project.

**Please read through the [contributing guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.**
