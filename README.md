Ineka is a **small and customizable** game engine made as **a passion project** to learn more about game and web development.

This project tries to make things its own way by proposing a **graph based structure** instead of a traditional ECS.

I prefer to warn you that this project was **made for personal use** but nothing is stopping you from using it or contributing.

## Getting started

### CLI installation
The simplest way to create a game project for Ineka is by using:
```bash
npx @ineka/create-game <name>
```

If you have **npm 6+** you can also use:
```bash
npm init @ineka/game <name>
# Or
npm create @ineka/game <name>
```

You can find [the cli package sources here](https://github.com/ineka-dev/create-game).

### Manual installation
You can also install the package using a package manager:
```bash
npm install @ineka/engine
```

Then use a bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to bundle your game.

## Packages

Ineka, by design, ships with a very minimal set of features. The goal is to offer an ecosystem of packages to customize the engine with **features you want and need** instead of imposing them.

This concept aims to **reduce bloat** and offer **a large panel of customization options**.
